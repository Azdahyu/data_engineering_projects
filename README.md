# Data Engineering Projects

This repository brings together all my personal data engineering projects, reflecting my growth and hands-on experience as a data engineer.

## Projects

- **Transport_Pipeline/**: This project implements a simple ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and logging.
It extracts raw data from an excel file, transforms the column names, and loads the result into a CSV file.
- **api-s3-snowflake-pipeline/**: This project builds a pipeline that collects data from a public API and converts it into a pandas dataframe, uploads the data to aws s3, ingests the data into snowflake, transforms it, and stores a star schema model for analytics.

## Tech Stack

These projects cover a range of tools and technologies, including:
- Python
- SQL
- Git & Github
- Cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3)
- Data warehousing (e.g., Snowflake)
- ETL/ELT workflows
